The plots have no titles, the contour levels are too far apart and the colors are off. Let's fix that.\n- Copy the code from above into the section below. \n- replace the line: \"cfp.con(global_warming_anom)\" with \"cfp.con(global_warming_anom, title='global warming - baseline Temperature Change (K)')\" to add a title to that plot.\n- Using the same approach, add a title to the solar geoengineering anom plot\n- in the line: cfp.levs(...), Change the values of min, max and step to cover the full range (or near-enough) for both anomalies and have a reasonable step-size. HINT: The earlier plots show the range of values for each anomaly. HINT2: the step-size needs to be small enough that you can see details, but not so small that the labels overrun each other or the plot becomes to busy to read.\n\nFor the colors to look right the levels have to be symmetric, e.g. -3 to +3, OR we need to tell the colorscale how to line up with the levels we want to plot. \n- if you have an asymmetric colorscale replace the line \"cfp.cscale('scale1')\" with \"cfp.cscale('scale1', below=X, above=Y)\" where X is the number of steps from zero to your minimum + 1 (for the less than extension of the colorscale), and Y is the number of steps from zero to your maximum + 1.","pos":23,"type":"cell"}

So, let's pick another colourscale.\n\n- Copy the code section above and this time plot precipitation change, 'PRECT'.\n- Change the colourscale to 'BrownBlue12'\n- Adjust the levels plotted and / or the number of colours above / below 0 as before to produce a nice-looking plot. HINT: it's OK to not plot the full range of data. \n- Change the title and add a colorbar label by adding: \", colorbar_title='Precipitation Change (mm/day)'\" to the cfp.con() call.\n- Optionally, you can remove the black lines from the contour plots by adding: \", lines=False\" to the end of the calls to cfp.con().
